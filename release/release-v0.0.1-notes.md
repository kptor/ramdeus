I release version 0.1 of **Ram Deus** [1] the AI reincarnation of Ram Dass

**Current Features**

Just two basic commands to start with:

- **/quote**: - fetches a random quote from the database
- **/advice**: - takes a problem and attempts to answer the way Ram Dass would (using GPT 4.1)

**Future/Planned Features**

Some ideas, please think about what you would want:

- Send **mindfulness reminders** in DMs upon request?
- Send quotes, ideas and lessons each morning and evening?
- Weekly/daily **koans** for the zen fuckers
- Schedule **multiplayer meditation** sessions (Discord has an Activities thing we can use to build this)
- Other **personas** (Buddha, Alan Watts, Sam Harris, Krishnamurti etc.)
- Suggest relevant **content** to enrich discussions
- There's lots of cool AI toys I have access to from work (don't tell my boss lmao)
  * Image gen
  * TTS

**Code**

- Hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/kptor/ramdeus
- Open source
- MIT License
- All contributions welcome
- If you're a beginner and need something to pad your CV/Resume DM me and we can work on stuff together :green_heart:

Only @.daereth has the power to summon **Ram Deus** into this realm if she so choose

[1] Deus as in *Deus Ex Machina* which is Latin for "god from the machine"

P.S. I really hope this isn't extremely offensive. Sometimes I think I shouldn't
be allowed to have ideas :sob:

P.P.S This is the first time in a long time I've done a coding thing for love
and fun and not money - so thank you, you beautiful weird motherfuckers - it
would be really cool to build it all together as a community! :green_heart:
